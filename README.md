## What

This plugin automatically add a mask on text layer and crop it to the same height to text view on iOS. Extra margin before first line and below last line will be crop out. So iOS engineer can just layout views according to the frame in sketch file and adjust margin by hand no more.

This plug in also provide a convenient method to set line height multiple.
